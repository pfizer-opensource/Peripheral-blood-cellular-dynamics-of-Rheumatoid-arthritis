ABSTRACT
Background
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic inflammation and is mediated by multiple immune cell types. In this work we aimed to determine the relevance of changes in cell proportions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during development of disease and during treatment.  
Methods
Samples from healthy blood donors, newly diagnosed RA patients, and established RA patients that had an inadequate response to MTX and were about to start tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) treatment were collected before and after 3 months treatment.  We used in parallel a computational deconvolution approach based on RNA expression and flow cytometry to determine the relative cell-type frequencies.
Results
Deconvolution of gene expression suggest that monocytes (both classical and non-classical) and CD4+ cells (Th1 and Th2) were increased in RA patients compared to controls, while NK cells and B cells (naïve and mature) were significantly decreased in RA patients. Treatment with MTX caused a decrease in B cells (memory and plasma cell), and a decrease in CD4 Th cells (Th1 and Th17), while treatment with TNFi resulted in a significant increase in the population of B cells.  
Conclusion 
Characterization of the RNA expression patterns and found that most of differentially expressed genes in RA subjects after treatment can be explained by changes in cell frequencies (98% and 74% respectively for MTX and TNFi).
